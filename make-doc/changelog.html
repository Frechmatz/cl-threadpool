<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

    <li>Removed :resignal-job-conditions argument from make-threadpool. The pool no longer handles conditions signalled by a job.</li>

    <li>Removed condition threadpool-error-queue-capacity-exceeded.</li>
    <li>Removed dependency 'verbose'. The library no longer depends on a logging framework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added run-jobs for synchronous execution of jobs.</li>
    <li>Added queue-size to get the number of jobs waiting for execution.</li>
    <li>Added pool-name to get the name of a thread pool.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 3.0.0</h2>

<p>This version shall be the last version which introduces breaking changes.</p>

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed cl-threadpool:start. A threadpool is now ready to use immediately after its instantiation.</li>
    <li>Removed condition threadpool-error. Pool usage errors and internal errors are now
	represented by simple-error.</li>
    <li>cl-threadpool:stop no longer returns an indicator if the pool has successfully been stopped. The status can be checked via cl-threadpool:pool-stopped-p.</li>
    <li>Error handling of jobs has been reworked. The threadpool now catches all unhandled conditions of jobs. If a job has signalled a condition and its result is requested, a job-execution-error is signalled by the threadpool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added add-job Adds a job to the queue and returns a future. The future represents the result of the asynchronously running job.</li>
    <li>Added job-value, cancel-job, job-done-p, job-cancelled-p.</li>
    <li>Added conditions job-execution-error and job-cancellation-error.</li>

</ul>
