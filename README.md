# cl-threadpool

A thread pool implemented in Common Lisp.

The thread pool consists of a bunch of worker threads and a job queue. It provides an
easy to use API with a focus on synchronous (blocking) execution of job batches.

Change-Log
----------

## Version 1.0.0 

This version is the current quicklisp release.

## Version 2.0.0

This version is a major rework of the thread pool with bugfixes, new features and
removal of features that have been identified as not being useful.

### Breaking changes

* Removed add-job. This function has been replaced with run-jobs.
* Removed :resignal-job-conditions argument from threadpool. The pool no longer handles conditions signalled by a job.
* Removed :max-queue-size argument from threadpool. The size of the job queue is now unlimited.
* Removed condition threadpool-error-queue-capacity-exceeded.
* Removed dependency 'verbose'. The library no longer depends on a logging framework.

### New features

* Added run-jobs for synchronous execution of jobs.
* Added queue-size to get the number of jobs waiting for execution.
* Added pool-name to get the name of a pool.

Installation
------------

Install (downloads and installs all dependencies)

    (ql:quickload "cl-threadpool")

Example
-------

Load cl-threadpool.

    (asdf:load-system "cl-threadpool")

Create a thread pool with 5 worker threads.

    (defparameter *threadpool* (cl-threadpool:make-threadpool 5))

Start the pool.

    (cl-threadpool:start *threadpool*)

Run some jobs. Blocks the current thread until all jobs have finished.

    (let ((results
           (cl-threadpool:run-jobs
            *threadpool*
            (list
             (lambda() (sleep 5) "Job 1")
             (lambda() (sleep 2) "Job 2")
             (lambda() (sleep 1) "Job 3")))))
      (format t "~a" (first results)) ;; => "Job 1"
      (format t "~a" (second results)) ;; => "Job 2"
      (format t "~a" (third results)))) ;; => "Job 3"

Stop the pool

    (cl-threadpool:stop *threadpool*)


API
---

* **make-threadpool** (size &key (name nil))

    * __size__ Number of worker threads
    * __name__  Name of the pool

    Returns an object representing a threadpool.
    
* **start** (pool)

    Starts the given pool by instantiating the worker threads.

* **run-jobs** (pool jobs)

   Synchronously executes a list of jobs. The current thread will be blocked until all jobs have been executed. 

    * __pool__ A threadpool   
    * __jobs__  A list of jobs. Each job is represented by a function with zero arguments. A Job is supposed to handle all conditions.

    Returns an ordered list of job results.

* **stop** (pool &key (timeout-seconds nil))

   Stops all worker threads. The function returns when all worker threads are no longer alive or when the timeout has been reached. Jobs still sitting in the queue may not be executed. The function does not destroy threads but signals to the worker threads that they are supposed to end. If a worker thread refuses to end it will be left running.
   
   Returns nil when all worker threads have been be stopped.

    * __timeout-seconds__ An optional timeout in seconds.
  
* **threadpoolp** (obj) => generalized boolean

   Returns t if the given object represents a thread pool.

* **worker-thread-p** (pool) => generalized boolean

   Returns t if the current thread is a worker thread of the pool.

* **queue-size** (pool)

   Returns the number of jobs waiting for execution.
  
* **pool-name** (pool)

   Returns the name of the pool.


Condition-Types
---------------

* **threadpool-error** (error)

   This condition is signalled by the pool in case of thread pool usage related errors.

Logging
-------

The threadpool logs low-level events by calling the function ``cl-threadpool:*logger*``
The default implementation of this function is empty.

Running the tests
-----------------

    (asdf:load-system "cl-threadpool-test")
    (in-package :cl-threadpool-test)
    (run-tests)
