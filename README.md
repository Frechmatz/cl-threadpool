# cl-threadpool

A thread pool implemented in Common Lisp.

A thread pool consists of a bunch of worker threads and a job queue. The focus of
this library is to provide a simple API which does not come with a lot of abstractions.

The full documentation can be found in the `docs` directory or at the [project
site](https://frechmatz.github.io/cl-threadpool/).
